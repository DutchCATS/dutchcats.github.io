        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">In this talk, we provide a categorical analysis of the arithmetic theory ùêºŒ£1. We will provide a categorical proof of the classical result that the provably total recursive functions in ùêºŒ£1 are exactly the primitive recursive functions. Our strategy is to first construct a coherent theory of arithmetic ùïã, and prove that ùïã presents the initial coherent category equipped with a parametrised natural number object. This allows us to derive the provably total functions in ùïã are exactly the primitive recursive ones, and establish some other constructive properties about ùïã. We also show that ùïã is exactly the Œ†2-fragment of ùêºŒ£1, and conclude they have the same class of provably total recursive functions.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Persistence modules are usually introduced to students through topological data analysis, since they are the main tool used to record information about a filtered space. However, it is also natural to define them from a purely algebraic viewpoint, for example, as functors from combinatorial entrance path categories or as cosheaves over some parameter space. From any of these algebraic definitions, we can then discuss the algebraic K-theory of persistence modules. We will find and interpret the K-theory of a particular class of persistence modules, as well as discuss how this result might be extended more generally. The intention of this talk is to leave listeners with a greater appreciation for persistence modules, algebraic K-theory, and the interesting content at the intersection of these ideas.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">We present a connection-based tableaux theorem prover that performs inferences entirely on the GPU. Benchmarks on the m40 dataset show it performs worse than other provers in terms of proving power. In terms of inferences per second, however, it is on par with or even surpassing state-of-the-art provers on similarly priced and dated hardware, despite it lacking various important optimizations that are present in the other provers. On top of this prover, we designed and implemented a heuristic neural network-based system that avoids evaluations during the computation of inferences, and instead pre-computes the results of these evaluations.</p>

          <div><b>Abstract:</b> At the TU/e, we have been using a customized version of the Coq proof assistant to help teach students how to write mathematical proofs. The software is called Waterproof, it consists of a custom proof language and a custom editor. The proof language provides tactics for writing Coq proofs that more closely resemble the style of regular math proofs. For example, the custom tactic notations take the form of full English sentences, and the focus is placed on types, which carry the relevant mathematical information, instead of on terms. The custom editor allows for the use of mixed documents which contain both human-readable text and verifiable mathematics. It contain some quality-of-life features, like autocompletion for typing mathematical symbols and tactics, as well as features specifically designed for use in education, like the ability to limit student input to certain parts of a document.  We will discuss Waterproof, its aims and its features, as well as how the software is used in the Analysis 1 course at the TU/e, and some limitations that we face with the creation of mathematical libraries that are accessible to first-year undergraduate students.

          <div><b>Abstract:</b> As the first talk of the workshop, we start by explaining and motivating propositional/weak/objective type theory (PTT), which is a type theory without any reduction rules. We compare two different categorical notions that aim to model PTT: compression categories with propositional identity types, and path categories. Although comprehension categories are well-studied, demonstrating that a category has the required structure for PTT can be difficult. Path categories simplify the requirements by taking inspiration from abstract homotopy theory. In this talk we will show an equivalence between these two notions, building upon the work of the invited speakers, and highlighting how their research connects.

      </summary>
        <div><b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, we consider a dependent type theory that includes propositional identity types, propositional dependent sum types, and propositional dependent product types: in other words, the intensional identities, the dependent sums, and the dependent products of our theory satisfy the usual Martin-L√∂f computation rules, but only in propositional form (see [3, 4, 5]). We will refer to such a theory as a weak type theory (or a propositional type theory). In a recent paper [6] the authors conjecture that such a theory is sufficient for performing all of constructive mathematics and formalising most of the HoTT book. <br>

          The aim of this talk is to address this question, by identifying a particular family of type-judgements, called h-elementary, of a weak type theory such that the corresponding extensional type theory is conservative over it relative to the family of h-elementary types. Our main result informally asserts that, for judgements essentially concerning h-sets, despite the non-negligible weakening of the weak type theories with respect to the extensional ones, reasoning with the latter or the former is equivalent. <br>
          
          Our argument is fully presented in [7]. It is obtained by adapting a proof strategy introduced in [2] and exploits the notion of category with attributes [1] to phrase the semantics of theories of dependent type. <br>

          <div>In ZF(C) and similar material set-theoretic foundations, the cumulative hierarchy of iterative sets provides the arena in which all mathematics takes place. In other foundations, its place is less central; but it still exists, as a rich and useful structure.

        <div>It is well known that the epimorphisms in the category of sets are
exactly the surjections. But what are the epimorphisms of types?
Thinking of types as spaces, and following literature in algebraic
topology, we characterise epimorphisms of types in homotopy type theory
(HoTT) as so-called acyclic maps. An acyclic map is a map whose fibres
are acyclic types, and a type is acyclic if its suspension is contractible.

We also consider a weaker notion: a type is k-acyclic (for k ‚â• -2) if
its suspension is k-connected. We show, for example, that the
classifying type of a group G is 2-acyclic if and only if the group G is
perfect, i.e. its abelianisation is trivial.

Finally, we comment on the relations between acyclic and connected maps,
sketch directions for future research, and describe how the Higman
group, a well-known example in combinatorial group theory, allows us to
construct a nontrivial acyclic type.

This is joint work with Ulrik Buchholtz and Egbert Rijke.</div>

            <div>Initial Semantics is a categorical framework enabling to abstractly represent
              and manipulate syntax with binder e.g. lambda calculus, with an appropriate
              notion of substitution and recursion. This is of important as substitution is 
              famously hard to account properly in a formal setting.
              In this talk, we will first consider different approaches that exist in the literature, 
              before giving some elements on how the different approaches relates and can be seen 
              as instances of a unified framework.</div>

  			  In this talk, I present three term calculi in a uniform format that respectively embody classical, intuitionistic and linear logics. These term calculi are equipped with reductions that satisfy subject reduction, confluence and strong normalisation. 
                          An advantage of the term calculi is their simplicity: They dispense with the tangled (commuting) conversions in existing term calculi, where conversions are one of the fundamental problems in proof theory. This simplicity also means the abstraction of my approach that discards the inessential syntactic details. By formulating the computations for the three logics in this abstract level, the present work deepens the computational analyses of the logics.

  			<summary>Abstract</summary>
  			Na√Øve category theory often makes implicit reference to sets, and thereby to a particular formulation of set theory. For example, we talk about the hom sets of locally small categories, small limits and colimits or the solution set condition of the adjoint functor theorem. Although almost all of homotopical algebra can be carried out in a purely algebraic way, we still see references to sets when we give explicit definitions of weak factorisation systems as cofibrantly generated by a set or small category of morphisms. We can break this dependence on sets using Grothendieck fibrations, where we replace the category of sets with a base category of our choice to serve as a foundation. The base category can be sets, but could also be a model of a particular choice of set theory or more generally an elementary topos, or even more generally a locally cartesian closed category or the category of small categories. If we have an external property of objects of the fibration that we are studying, it is natural to ask when we can talk about it in the internal language of our base. As a minimal condition we expect that such properties are stable under reindexing, but it turns out this is not strong enough. We can think of an object in the total category of a fibration intuitively as an "indexing object" I in the base together with a family of objects indexed by I, say (X_i)_I. What we need is a subobject of I in the base that tells us which objects X_i have the property we are interested in. This idea is captured remarkably well by B√©nabou's notion of *definability*. For example, in many examples of Grothendieck fibrations the subterminal objects are stable under reindexing, but definability requires something more. An example where they are definable are codomain fibrations on Heyting categories: we can use the equality and universal quantifiers of the internal language to state what it means for any two elements of a type to be equal, which turns out to witness the definability of subterminal objects in the fibration.
			<br>
			However, B√©nabou's definition applies only to properties of objects and not to structure. For structure we can use a new definition introduced by Shulman under the name *locally representable*. I'll give a reformulation of Shulman's definition making it clear that it can be seen as a generalisation of B√©nabou's in the same spirit, encompassing not just definability, but also Johnstone's earlier generalisation of comprehensivity. Just as we considered stability under reindexing as a minimal requirement for properties, we first consider *notions of fibred structure* or just *notions of structure* on a fibration. We think of this as a kind of structure which is defined externally to the fibration, but stable under reindexing. Reindexing stable classes are a special case, which we refer to as *full* notions of structure, but so are Johnstone's comprehension schemes and any time we have a (co)monad over a fibration, the category of (co)algebras is another example.
			<br>
			I am particularly interested in the case of algebraic weak factorisation systems (awfs), which are notions of structure on codomain fibrations with the property of being monadic, and equipped with certain extra structure. I give a sufficient criterion for awfs's to be definable, as cofibrantly generated by a family of maps with tiny codomain. This uses a general definition of tiny in a fibration, that can be applied to codomain fibrations to obtain a result similar to that of Licata, Orton, Pitts and Spitters, or can be applied to set or category indexed families to obtain a different looking result referring to maps that are tiny in an external sense that can be phrased using hom set functors.
			<br>
			I will also list some examples of non definable notions of structure based on Kan fibrations, which are widely used in homotopical algebra and can be defined in any topos with interval object. A large class of weak factorisation systems cannot be definable as full notions of structure unless the axiom of choice holds. In some interesting special cases the awfs of Kan fibrations can be shown to be non-locally representable using logical properties of the interval object, even in classical logic with the axiom of choice. In simplicial sets this can be done using the fact that the interval has a linear order (in a certain sense the interval object of simplicial sets is the "generic" linear order with endpoints) and can be done in BCH cubical sets using the fact that the interval has "separable diagonal."

  			  Grothendieck abelian categories can be seen, on one hand, as the Ab-enriched topoi, and on the other hand, as the (categorical counterpart of) noncommutative schemes. In particular, the 2-category Grt‚ô≠ of Grothendieck abelian categories with left exact left adjoint additive functors, which is nothing but the Ab-enriched counterpart of the 2-category of topoi and geometric morphisms, is a natural environment in order to study noncommutative flat algebraic geometry. In this talk we show that the Bird-Kelly tensor product of (enriched) locally presentable categories endows Grt‚ô≠ with a monoidal structure, which is a linear counterpart of the product of topoi and at the same time can be considered as a noncommutative parallel of the product of schemes with flat morphisms between them.  Moreover, in an effort to shed some light on the exponentiability of schemes, we study the exponentiable objects in Grt‚ô≠. More concretely, we provide a characterization of the exponentiable objects in Grt‚ô≠ by following a linear parallel to Johnstone and Joyal‚Äôs characterization of exponentiable topoi.
